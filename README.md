- Hey @nathanduft44!

Thanks for this contribution!
Before we go ahead with these changes, we should start a discussion around this feature on discord? https://chat.tally.cash

This is a bigger engineering lift, and it's not currently on our roadmap. Because of this, I don't see clearly how this feature will be finished to a releasable state and it would be a shame to leave it half finished.
